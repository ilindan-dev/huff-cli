A command-line tool for data compression...

A command-line tool for data compression based on the Huffman algorithm.

This project provides a CLI utility to encode (compress) and decode (decompress) text files using Huffman coding. It is optimized to handle large files by leveraging multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks.

## Features

-   **Encode:** Compresses ASCII text files into a binary format.
-   **Decode:** Decompresses files back to the original text.
-   **Performance:** Uses an adaptive strategy — a fast single-threaded approach for small files and a parallelized multi-process approach for large files (e.g., >1MB).
-   **Asynchronous I/O:** File operations are performed asynchronously to prevent blocking.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ilindan-dev/huff-cli/huff-cli.git
    cd huff-cli
    ```
2.  Install the project in editable mode (recommended for development):
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file, installs dependencies, and makes the `huff-cli` command available in your terminal.

## Usage

The CLI has two main commands: `encode` and `decode`.

### Encode a file

```bash
huff-cli encode [INPUT_FILE] [OUTPUT_FILE] --print-tree
```

### Decode a file
```bash
huff-cli decode [INPUT_FILE] [OUTPUT_FILE] --print-tree
```
